            <h2>More about Trevino</h2>
              <p>
                The trait that I and others would say is my strongest is my ambition,
                my refusal to give up on something I want to achieve. Giving my best
                is something that has been instilled in me since the primary school with 
                the motto of the school being "Only the Best is Good Enough". To no
                surprise, this has a significant impact on my academic life. As any
                normal human being, there are times when I simply just dont want to do 
                the work assigned to me or I am tired and desire rest or personal time. 
      
                However, due to my ambition I always find some energy or motivation to 
                continue working. Even if that means staying up until 5am doing the
                assignment. This ofcourse has it results in the level of academic 
                success I was able to achieve. Not that I only get A's but that when
                there are times when I wanted to give up or settle for a low score, I 
                contiue to pull through and achieve higher than I would if I gave up.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                The strongest emotion I feel is honestly tranquility, I do feel other emotions
                however I rarely express them. I typically choose to go down the path of analyzing
                how I feel, why I feel, and how I can change that feeling if it is not desired.
                
                This does impact my academic life in his own way. When under things such as academic
                stress or even with things in life, it rarely ever hinders my ability to get my work 
                done.

                My favourite hobby is playing video games, this has been my favourite hobby since I was
                a child. Gaming with family to now gaming with local and online friends. To the surprise
                of many, I've learnt many lessons and have developed many attributes and qualities of 
                myself through this hobby. Some good ones are coordination, teamwork and communication.
      
                These qualities mainly helped me to become a better group member and leader. Which had
                and still has a great impact on my academic life.
