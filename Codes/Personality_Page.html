        <p>
          The trait that I and others would say is my strongest is my ambition,
          my refusal to give up on something I want to achieve. Giving my best
          is something that has been instilled in me since the primary school with 
          the motto of the school being "Only the Best is Good Enough". To no
          surprise, this has a significant impact on my academic life. As any
          normal human being, there are times when I simply just dont want to do 
          the work assigned to me or I am tired and desire rest or personal time. 

          However, due to my ambition I always find some energy or motivation to 
          continue working. Even if that means staying up until 5am doing the
          assignment. This ofcourse has it results in the level of academic 
          success I was able to achieve. Not that I only get A's but that when
          there are times when I wanted to give up or settle for a low score, I 
          contiue to pull through and achieve higher than I would if I gave up.

          The strongest emotion I feel is honestly tranquility, I do feel other emotions
          however I rarely express them. I typically choose to go down the path of analyzing
          how I feel, why I feel, and how I can change that feeling if it is not desired.
          
          This does impact my academic life in its own way. When under things such as academic
          stress or even with things in life, it rarely ever hinders my ability to get my work 
          done.

          My favourite hobby is playing video games, this has been my favourite hobby since I was
          a child. Gaming with family to now gaming with local and online friends. To the surprise
          of many, I've learnt many lessons and have developed many attributes and qualities of 
          myself through this hobby. Some good ones are coordination, teamwork and communication.

          These qualities mainly helped me to become a better group member and leader. Which had
          and still has a great impact on my academic life.

          Here's a link to my steam profile, which will display more specific information on
          the genres I enjoy the most, the games I have the most time on and also the games I have 
          been enjoying recently.

        <p>"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
            glorify your Father which is in heaven". My hero is the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, He is the the hero of us all. I chose Him to be my hero because He is the one that died for me 
            and cleansed me of my sins. He continues to be a beacon of hope, love, grace and righteousness in me and my family's lives. Additonally, only through Him may we meet or make contact with
            the Father, which is in Heaven. As I continue to grow in the Lord, learn of His tender mercies and learn of what He has done in the lives of others, it is no doubt that He will be my hero,\
            my inspiration. The entire Christian journey is be like Him, perfect in God's Word, so that we may enter the kingdom so He is both my inspiration and aspiration. He is the perfect role model
            as to how I should live my life and how I should treat others. My wish and goal is to possess the qualities He does and to take heed to His Word.

                  The qualities that a Guardian have are that they are factual, cautious, respectable, dependable, law-abiding, concerned, steady, logistical and detailed. The results are very valid because these
                  are qualities that myself and others would say that I have. Throughout my life there has been various times where I have displayed these exact qualities so I trust in the validity of
